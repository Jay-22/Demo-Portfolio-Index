	  <h4>What I do:</h4>
	     <p>I'm a Computer Science Student at Trinity College Dublin and I plan to move to Canada with my        girlfriend, Meagan!</p>
    
    <h4>What I enjoy doing:</h4>  
      <p>I love gaming, especially FFXIV: ONLINE. It is probably the game I've sinked most of my time into. It's super immersive and has a great story. I also have a passion for music both listening and playing. I play 5 different instruments and I have been classically trained in Singing. I hope to achieve more in these coming years!</p>
